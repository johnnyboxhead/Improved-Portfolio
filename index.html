            <p>
                I was born and raised in Central Virgina, living in and around the Richmond area my entire life.  My early life was idylic, spending a great deal of my free time on either my Grandparent's farm or in the waters of the Outer Banks.
                <br>
                <br>
                After high school I spent a few years at a local college, but left to join Capital One, where I've spent the last 20 years.  My professional growth over the years at Capital One has been extrodinary and I've been presented with opportunities to drive change involving thousands of employees and millions of customers.
                <br>
                <br>
                During my time with Capital One I've gained knowledge/expertise beyond what I even knew existed when I started this professional journey. I've acquired my Six Sigma Yellow Belt, Agile Scrum Master certifification, led several Lean efforts to improve processes, and am currently a Product Owner driving intent for a team focused on new strategies to drive our customers to self-service.
                <br>
                <br>
                I've always had a fascination with technology and first learned minimal coding about 10 years ago.  I'm now embarking on a new journey to learn the world of full stack web development and loving every minute of it.  I've found new passion in creating both inviting front end experiences and in developing the backend logic that underpins them.  I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, but I'm also enjoying every minute of the ride ...

            <h2>SpeakIT</h2>
            <p>This was a group project with a concept of connecting users who want to learn how to speak other languages with users who are already fluent speakers of those other languages.  This would be a way to learn another language naturally/conversationally without using a program like Babel or Rosetta Stone to do so.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Key elements in this project were the ability to create users (including username/password), ability to retrieve data from a database, ability to connect users, and the ability to chat.  My parts of the project were: writing the routes for returning information from our users table, developing the routes/models for the connections table, and returning connected users from the connections table.</p>

            <h2>GatheRVA</h2>
            <p>This was another group project where we decided to tackle the challenge of figuring out what to do next weekend in Richmond, VA.  While there are plenty of event calendars, none of them aggregate inputs from both open source APIs and events created by users of the website, GatheRVA does just that.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Key elements in this project were the ability to pull data from APIs, parsing and rendering the API data on our webpage, and using Firebase storage to allow users to create new events.  My parts of this project were pulling data from the eventful API, parsing it, then rendering it to the webpage.  I also shot, edited, and added the video (including drone footage) to the background.</p>

            <h2>Bamazon</h2>
            <p>This was an individual project to create a Node application that simulates a store in Terminal/Gitbash.  The users are able to make purchases which are then deducted from the store's inventory.  Managers are able to add items and update inventory.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Key elements in this project were the ability to save the inventory in a MySQL database, querying the database to retrieve items, using Inquirer for users to select products, then using queries to update inventory.  While this isn't much to look at, it was fun to create and to use.</p>

        <div id="Project4">
            <h2>Giftastic</h2>
            <p>This was an individual project to create a website that is able to retrieve and watch .gifs based on a user's input.  The user can select which of the three pre-selected vehicles they want to see burn rubber or can add a vehicle of their choice.  Once a vehicle button has been added to the top of the page the user can press that button to return 10 gifs of that vehicle.  The user can then click on any thumbnail to start the .gif and click it again to stop it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Key elements in this project were the ability to take input from a user and pass that into an call to the Giphy API.  Once the return from the API is recieved it then has to be parsed and rendered on the front end.</p>
