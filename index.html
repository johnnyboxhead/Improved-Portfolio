            I was born and raised in Central Virgina, living in and around the Richmond area my entire life.  My early life was idylic, spending a great deal of my free time on either my Grandparent's farm or in the waters of the Outer Banks.

            I joined Capital One in 1998 and over the last 20 years have been presented with opportunities to drive change involving thousands of employees and millions of customers. I've acquired my Six Sigma Yellow Belt, Agile Scrum Master certifification, led several Lean efforts to improve processes, and am currently a Product Owner developing new strategies to drive our customers to self-service.

            I've always had a fascination with technology and first learned to code about ten years ago.  I'm now embarking on a new journey to learn full stack web development and loving every minute of it.  I've found new passion in creating both inviting front end experiences and in developing the backend logic that underpins them.  I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, but I'm also enjoying every minute of the ride ...

            <h2>River-Rat</h2>
            <p id="RRPara1">This was a group project to provide key stats on the James River in Richmond, VA that aren't easily accessable/undestandable elsewhere.  This is a full MERN app using MongoDB to story user data/comments, Passport for authentication, and hitting both the USGS and Google Maps APIs.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="RRPara2">Key elements in this project were the ability to obtain river data via API, locate parks, obtain key information about each park, create users (including username/password), ability to retrieve user info, ability to create comments, and the ability to retrieve comments.  My parts of the project were: connecting to the USGS API, syling the API data retrieved, creating the logic around activity recommendations,creating the route and logic for submitting comments, creating the outfitters page that displays a list of merchants, writing logic to ensure unacthenticated users couldn't get to the authenticated space, and logic around the component updates throughout the app.</p>

            <h2>SpeakIT</h2>
            <p id="P1Para1">This was a group project with a concept of connecting users who want to learn how to speak other languages with users who are already fluent speakers of those other languages.  This would be a way to learn another language naturally/conversationally without using a program like Babel or Rosetta Stone to do so.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="P1Para2">Key elements in this project were the ability to create users (including username/password), ability to retrieve data from a database, ability to connect users, and the ability to chat.  My parts of the project were: writing the routes for returning information from our users table, developing the routes/models for the connections table, and returning connected users from the connections table.</p>

            <h2>GatheRVA</h2>
            <p id="P2Para1">This was another group project where we decided to tackle the challenge of figuring out what to do next weekend in Richmond, VA.  While there are plenty of event calendars, none of them aggregate inputs from both open source APIs and events created by users of the website, GatheRVA does just that.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="P2Para2">Key elements in this project were the ability to pull data from APIs, parsing and rendering the API data on our webpage, and using Firebase storage to allow users to create new events.  My parts of this project were pulling data from the eventful API, parsing it, then rendering it to the webpage.  I also shot, edited, and added the video (including drone footage) to the background.</p>

            <h2>Bamazon</h2>
            <p id="P3Para1">This was an individual project to create a Node application that simulates a store in Terminal/Gitbash.  The users are able to make purchases which are then deducted from the store's inventory.  Managers are able to add items and update inventory.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="P3Para2">Key elements in this project were the ability to save the inventory in a MySQL database, querying the database to retrieve items, using Inquirer for users to select products, then using queries to update inventory.  While this isn't much to look at, it was fun to create and to use.</p>

        <div id="Project4">
            <h2>Giftastic</h2>
            <p id="P4Para1">This was an individual project to create a website that is able to retrieve and watch .gifs based on a user's input.  The user can select which of the three pre-selected vehicles they want to see burn rubber or can add a vehicle of their choice.  Once a vehicle button has been added to the top of the page the user can press that button to return 10 gifs of that vehicle.  The user can then click on any thumbnail to start the .gif and click it again to stop it.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="P4Para2">Key elements in this project were the ability to take input from a user and pass that into an call to the Giphy API.  Once the return from the API is recieved it then has to be parsed and rendered on the front end.</p>
